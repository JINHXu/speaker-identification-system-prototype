## Abstract

> Speaker identification has numerous applications in various areas. Over the years, there has been a rising need for automated speaker identification systems in the industry. This thesis explores __text-independent__ speaker identification on short audio samples using __data-driven__ methods. In particular, it concentrates on the available solutions with high identification accuracy and seeks to build a high-performance practical system. The experiments compare two of the state- of-the-art statistical models for the task, examine the effect of the amount of training data on model performance in closed-set and open-set settings, and ex- amine the effect of marginal change on inference audio length on identification accuracy. The highest accuracy achieved by both models in the experiments surpass __0.985 in a closed-set setting__, and __0.978 in an open-set setting__. Beyond discussing the observations and findings from the experiments, this thesis describes the practical speaker identification systems built in the process based on the experiment results and provides a reproducible pipeline for building a high-performance practical speaker identification system.
